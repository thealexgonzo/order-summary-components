## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- BEM
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a lot with this project, in particular working with the `box-shadow` and `background-image` properties in CSS, which are two concepts I need to learn more about as I am not completely satisfied with how the code turned out, I believe it could have been done a lot better.

With this project I used Figma for the first time, I found it to be a fantastic tool to create and share designs which I'm keen to keep using and learning about going forwards.

### Continued development

As I mention above, I would like to continue learning about background images and box shadows so I can use them more expertly in the future. Although it is a very small project which I won't spend too much time on, I did find when viewing it on an iPhone 8 and and iPhone 11 that the display was a lot different and there were a couple issues, specifically with the background wave image and the box-shadow for the component card which didn't look right on either device due to the size of display or the when scrolling up and down.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me find the correct syntax for the `box-shadow` property.
- [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob) - Kevin's YouTube channel is always a great resource for CSS knowledge and it helped me understand background images a bit better.
